Make donuts decentralized again!

There's clearly demand for an upgrade from mere Reddit donuts to erc-20 donuts. People want to upgrade their social media experiences to the possibilities provided by a dynamic web3 market based environment. People want to explore break free from the oppressive sandboxes created by centralized platforms and mods.

There have been experiments with this in /r/recdao and https://donut.dance, but both suffered from centralization and high friction for users, and tx fees for developers. DUNK 1 proposes a new system that aims to decentralize the entire process, like donuts should be, transparent to their core and without holes. This means that donut creation, trading, and governance needs to happen on chain in a way that is clear and permissionless. If it fails, who cares?! They're donuts... If it works, we learn a lot and potentially create a protocol that can generalize to bridge more web2 platforms/communities to web3 ecosystems/opportunities. 

This DUNK aims to specify the core features we want the protocol to have, and subsequent DUNKS can address how exactly we might go about achieving them :)

DOH Protocol Goals
- decentralized: no single point of failure or power
- trustless: everything can be verified publically incase it breaks or someone cheats
- fun: we're fancy monkeys that wear cloths and live on a spec of dust suspended in a sunbeam... let's not get carried away with ourselves here lol
- easy: it must not require a herculian amount of effort from developers, users, or any platform/community it interacts with. This means that:
  - once the developers build the protocol, minus bugs or voluntary upgrades, it should "just work"
  - users don't need to download an app, extension, or do anything beyond having an ethereum wallet and reddit account
  - it is not dependant on cooperation or support from the platform/community which it interfaces with - the current donut system relies on Reddit mods, but we want something that is truly permissionless and opt-in
- open: anyone can comment on, build on, or break the protocol in the small game through code or a larger game via economic/social incentives - we welcome experimentation and view this as such.
- what else? You decide! Submit a PR to this DUNK :)
