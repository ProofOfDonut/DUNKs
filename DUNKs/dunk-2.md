# DUNK 2
Addressing low value spammers and high value whales so that the entire community can flourish. 

### General
Donuts are cool. Donuts are yummy. We all want donuts. This means that as donuts become more and more popular there will be increased incentives to find sneaky ways to aquire them. One of the main concerns is spammers shitposting and using sockpuppets to get free donuts from the weekly donut allocation. Another concern is donut whales buying up all the supply and manipulating the market and community. This would ruin it for everyone. I propose 2 mechanisms to address this:
- donut staking
- quadratic donut weighting

### Donut Staking
IF the donut creation, allocation, and voting process can be decentralized in a trustless setting by moving the donut protocol to Ethereum rather than having it primarily operate on Reddit... then you could have donut staking where in order to earn donuts you have to stake an initial amount (could be gifted or purchased in ETH/DAI). Numerai already does this and it's greatly increased the quality of their user submissions. Here you could have a similar mechanism where by making an initial stake you're saying that you intend to participate in a way that ads value. If you're spamming the community you'll get downvoted and your donut stake will be slashed, but if you're adding value you'll be upvoted and rewarded by the donut allocation oracle/mechanism.

### Quadratic Weighting
Donut votes will be represented as the square root of the total a user/account holds. 
- 1 donut = 1 vote
- 4 donuts = 2 votes
- 9 donuts = 3 votes
- etc...
This way those with more donuts will still be weighted more heavily, but new people will also be encouraged to join in. This creates incentives to participate, but dicourages whaling. This is important because as the donut protocol evolves it will most likely attract people from outside of the core /r/ethtrader community. Some of these people might be spammers, but there might also be those who are interested in exploring cryptoeconomic mechanisms and have not engaged much in /r/ethtrader because they focus on protocol design and not trading. It's important we create a system that encourages and incentivizes the broader community to join in as this will make the donut protocol more useful, legitimate, and valuable.
