# DUNK 3
An oracle/validator model to get data from Reddit (or any social network on the web) to the donut protocol

A truly decentralized and permissionless donut protocol? It's tricky because on one extreme you have the option of slightly augmenting Reddit's native donut/voting system, but the constraints of the current centralization of Reddit + mod power is a bit of a drag and the mods still have all the power (as we see in /r/ethtrader). At the other extreme a fully Ethereum based dApp that a subreddit just mirrors, but that has high setup costs and adoption/engagement would be unknown. I see the donut protocol more as a bridge to connect web2 platforms/users to web3 ecosystems/possibilities. The core protocols and contracts live on Ethereum, but engagement could (ideally) happen via arbitrary channels (such as Reddit) that send data to the contracts.

This is a wonderful opportunity to explore oracle systems as a data bridge between Reddit and Ethereum:
- If that process were made public then it could be fed into a contract that allocates donuts on Ethereum rather than mods here on Reddit
- Since the algorithm is public people could then verify that the contract is acting honestly, and if it's not sell/convert their donuts to a new token with another governance process
- This could add legitimacy to donuts, be a testing ground for cryptoeconomic mechanisms that could be generalized to larger games, and would be fun af to experiment with esp because there's more incentive to attack it if it's perceived as legitimate and then that gives us opportunities to learn how to keep it secure :)
